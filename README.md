### Description

A Napster Client based on opennap/slavanap protocol specs. it supports chat/pm/all forms of transfers/easy server connection/script support in chat/private message/hotlist/browse files/ and basic media player ability. a install and more screenshots available at http://www.intradream.com/inap/index.html . it dosnt have the file base some of the newer p2p apps have but it certinly isnt dead tons of people still use audioGnome and there still is a bunch of servers to connect to. i recomend using it for chating. Thats the best part of napster in my opinion.
